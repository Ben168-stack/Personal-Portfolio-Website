            <p>Hello again, welcome to my projects. On this page I want to share more on my thought process while working on these applications and 
              why I started working on these applications. I truly enjoyed making these applications and hope
              you will like them too.

            <img src="../img/matchingGame2.jpg" alt="Image of Matching game">
            <p>This is the first application I made in my list of Projects. 
              I followed a tutorial on a course I got on Udemy,this was one of the applications in the course.</p>
            <p>I had to use for loops to create the many divs(folding cards) of this application and some DOM elements.
              It was pretty intimidating as this was new territory to me but I learnt alot at the end and was able to finish it.

            <p>This is the Second application I made for this portfolio. This one is much less complicated. It was mostly just some simple CSS and animations.</p>
            <p>Some stuff I was unfamilar with were animation variable names @keyframes transfrom:translate Y, est.However they weren't too difficult
              to pick up and I learnt even more stuff aftering finishing it.

            <h3>Magic 8 Ballüé±</h3>
            <img src="../img/magic8ball2.jpg" alt="Image of Magic 8 ball">
            <p>This is my Third Application I made and its a magic 8 ball. I found a tutorial on Youtube credits to "Carla Notarobot" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlcoJVn8y3I&t=32s" target="_blank" style="color: red;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlcoJVn8y3I&t=32s</a>
              I thought that a magic 8 ball application would be pretty interesting and I created a similar application using switches on console before and wanted to recreate it
              on a webpage
            </p>
            <p>I would say the main challenge was how to get the Javascript working on a site and ensure it still looks visually appealing. In the Tutorial I used buttons in HTML to run
              a function in Javascript which both writes a message with .innerHTML and creates a class which causes an animation to run in the css code.As for the animation I used @keyframes
              and the ball in a way jiggle up and down if you look at my code there is a pattern I did in the animation giving it a shake like animation. Again more things I learnt and got to practice
              on while making this application.

            <img src="../img/GunBearHuman2.jpg" alt="Image of Gun Bear Human">
            <p>This is the final application for my portfolio and It may be the one I'm most proud of. I made a game similar to Rock Paper Scissors before Call Gun Bear Human
              I coded it into the console before using functions and if and else if, est. If you are interested here is a link to my Github to get the code https://github.com/Ben168-stack/Gun-Bear-Human-ConsoleVersion/tree/main 
            </p>
            <p>I was wondering how I could code this onto my website and still make it look visually appealing. So I followed through some rock paper scissors tutorials
              on Youtube and changed some of the Javascript code to meet the output I want and of course change the images to something more fitting to the game I wanted to create.
              In the end I used Switches which I learnt from my time in NYP and some DOM elements such as .innerHTML, and es6 code like 'let' or 'const' or backticks ``.
              Learnt alot from this application and was able to put what I learnt in school to make this application. I was even able to make a scoreBoard. I hope to make
              more cool stuff in the future and use what I learnt from these applications.
